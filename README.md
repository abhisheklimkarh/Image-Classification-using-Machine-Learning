# Image-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

This project emphasises on using neural networks to design an image classification model.
This project is executed on Google Colab.
The dataset used in this project is from CIFAR10.
We use different libraries such as tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, and numpy in this project.
